# IT Support Runbook

Short, practical troubleshooting notes and help desk runbooks.
Focus: Windows, basic networking, and customer support workflows.

## What’s inside
- `/windows` - Windows troubleshooting notes
- `/networking` - DNS/Wi-Fi basics and checklists
- `/templates` - documentation templates

## Why
I document fixes so issues are repeatable, faster to resolve, and easier to hand off.
